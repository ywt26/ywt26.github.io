\begin_layout Title
Does Housing Price Impede the Rising Birth Rate?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Yao Weitong
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the Malthusian theory of population, it’s the idea that population
 growth is potentially exponential while the growth of the food supply is
 linear.
 Malthusianism has concluded two “checks” to impede the population growth:
 “preventive checks” (moral restraints) and “positive checks” (disease,
 starvation, war.etc.).
 Obviously, technology development hasn’t been taken into account by Malthusian;
 in another words, these “checks” affect little in modern society, and the
 population of the world will rise dramatically (and it does!)
\begin_inset Formula $^{[1]}$
\end_inset

.
 However, some people study the relationship between high housing price
 and declining birth rate in Japan and they consider the rising housing
 price, as cost of raising babies, is a kind of “check” of Malthusiam.
 Is it true and general? Based on the dramatically increasing housing price
 in China since 2008, I would like to check whether housing prices do reduce
 fertility in the long run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Regression Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fertility rates are linked to many factors, such as the cost of raising
 children – rising house prices, education – especially the ratio of female
 educated, women’s labor participation rate, the idea of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 – reflected in pension expenditures and the entire society’s elderly dependency
 rate.
 This passage collects data from the National Bureau of Statistics in mainland
 China from 2000 to 2017, and supplements it with data from the China Statistica
l Yearbook to make a simple multiple linear regression and to make a simple
 diagnosis of the model.

Obviously, there is a problem of multicollinearity in this linear regression.
 To improve this modle, the passage uses ridge regression instead of simple
 multiple linear regression.

Ridge Regression
\begin_inset Formula $^{[2,3]}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The logit that ridge regression can solve multicollinearity problem is to
 reduce the variance of parameter estimators, at the cost of sacrifying
 unbiasness.
 The general principle of ridge regression is to add a constraint to the
 parameter after the cost function, based on the MLE.
 This constraint is called a 
\series bold
regularizer

.
 The cost function of ridge regression is

\begin_layout Subsection
Explanation of Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results show that in the long run, the feritility rate is only negatively
 correlated with the divorce rate and education.
 The influence of devorce rate is greater in an economical sense, and the
 statistical results are more significant, too.
 It has nothing to do with the rate of house price appreciation.
 Further, assuming that there is a strong correlation between the increase
 in house prices and the divorce rate, I further run two regression and
 find that the results are either insignificant or significant but weakly
 correlated.
 Although the cost of raising children is rising when house prices rise,
 the regression shows that women's labor participation rate and GDP growth
 explain the decline in child dependency ratio more.
 Therefore, the decline in fertility in the long-term cannot be attributed
 to the rise in housing prices; or said, the house as a fixed asset is the
 main collateral for developers and corporate borrowing.
 In order to maintain the normal economy operation, the government would
 like maintain stability rather than suppress it.
 Directly speaking, it is an inevitable trend that house prices are at high
 prices, but people wouldn't choose to be DINK because of this.
 It is obvious that the house only temporarily sway the decision of fertility,
 but it cannot affect fertility in the long run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion and Other Evidences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other evidences can show why they are not exactly negatively correlated.
 First is about the two-sided impacts.
 According to
\shape italic
 Lisa J.Dettling and Melissa S.Kearne
\shape default
y
\begin_inset Formula $^{[4]}$
\end_inset

, current house prices can lead to a negative effect on the fertility rates
 among renters but positive effect on births among homeowners during the
 current period and these two effects can offset each other.
 Second, children-rearing cost is a bridge linking housing prices and fertility
 rate, however, the young dependency rate is falling in recent year, from
 the data collected from National Bureau of Statistics.
 In other words, if having a children but not raising them, then the impact
 of housing prices on fertility rate will not be established.
 Third one is the elasticity issue.
 By 
\shape italic
Creina Day and Ross Guest
\shape default

\begin_inset Formula $^{[5]}$
\end_inset

, the key is the level of substitution effect of rising female wages on
 fertility depends on how important housing is as a cost of children; price
 elasticity of housing supply is low in Asia, so the increasing wage leads
 to decreasing birth rate.
 Things are different in western countries, where housing supply is relatively
 price elastic.
